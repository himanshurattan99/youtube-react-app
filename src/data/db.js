In this video, he'll detail his six steps on how you can learn to draw anything and provide you with a better understanding of form, design, and structure. You'll learn how to break down complex subjects into simple shapes, the importance of shape design, and get some valuable tips on manipulating basic shapes to make them more dynamic and interesting. If you've been trying to draw the world around you (or from imagination) and your artwork is not living up to your expectations, then this lesson will really help you out.",
